# Ada

## Notes:
* Press <Tab> will help you re-format your code.
* Take a look at Edit -> Project properties -> (Directories, Files, Main) when:
  * Start new project.
  * Your files did not appear in the side bar.
  * etc

Look at:
	with function "<" ( A, B: Elem ) return Boolean is <>;
	=> The "<>" symbol means if you did not implement "<" then it will use the default implementation of "<";
	type Index is (<>);
	=> The "<>" symbol means discrete type.
	
T'Range = T'First..T'Last
